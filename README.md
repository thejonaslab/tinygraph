TinyGraph is a Python package for working on weighted, undirected graphs with no self-loops. TinyGraph was intended for use with small graphs (<128 vertices).

TinyGraph was designed to be extensible and interface well with numpy, but also fast and supportive of dense graphs for use in ML applications. 

## Installation

TinyGraph is provided under the [New BSD License](LICENSE). We will eventually make TinyGraph available on PyPI but
for the time being you can install directly from Github via 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/thejonaslab/tinygraph.git
```

## Documentation
