# TinyGraph

TinyGraph is a Python package for working on weighted, undirected graphs with no self-loops. TinyGraph was intended for use with small graphs (<128 vertices).

TinyGraph was designed to be extensible and interface well with numpy, but also fast and supportive of dense graphs for use in ML applications.
